Given a binary tree, you have to return the size of it. Size of binary tree is defined as number of nodes in it.

Examples:

Input:      
       1
     /  \
    2    3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three nodes in given binary tree.
Input:
      10
     /  \
   5     9
   \    / \
    1 3   6
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six nodes in given binary tree.
Input:
      1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is one nodes in given binary tree.
Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data <= 105
